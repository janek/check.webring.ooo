# ADR-002: Progressive Data Loading Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The app needs to handle potentially large datasets (10k-100k names) while maintaining fast page load times and responsive search functionality. We need to balance:
- Fast initial page load (especially on mobile)
- Responsive search experience
- Comprehensive search results
- Scalability as the dataset grows

## Decision
We will implement a **progressive loading strategy** with hybrid search:

### Loading Strategy
1. **Initial load**: 30 random names displayed immediately on page load
2. **Background load**: Additional ~1k names loaded asynchronously without blocking UI
3. **On-demand load**: Server-side search for comprehensive results when needed

### Search Strategy
1. **Instant search**: User input immediately searches the cached 1k names
2. **Server fallback**: Simultaneously query server for complete results
3. **Progressive results**: Show cached results first, update with server results when available

## Rationale
- **Performance**: 30 names (~2KB) loads instantly vs 100k names (~5MB)
- **User Experience**: Immediate content + responsive search
- **Scalability**: Works regardless of total dataset size
- **Mobile-friendly**: Minimal initial bandwidth usage
- **Future-ready**: Supports advanced features like analytics, personalization

## Implementation Details
### API Endpoints
- `GET /names/sample?count=30` - Random sample for initial load
- `GET /names/cache?count=1000` - Background cache population
- `GET /search?q={query}&limit=50` - Server-side search

### Frontend Behavior
- Page load: Request sample names, display immediately
- Background: Request cache names, store locally
- Search: Filter cached results + async server query
- Results: Cached results shown first, server results merged/updated

### Caching Strategy
- Client-side: Store 1k names in memory/localStorage
- Server-side: Consider which 1k names to prioritize (popularity, recency, etc.)
- Cache invalidation: Timestamp-based or versioning

## Consequences
### Positive
- Fast perceived performance
- Scalable to large datasets
- Responsive search experience
- Progressive enhancement pattern

### Negative
- More complex implementation than simple "load all" approach
- Need to handle result merging logic
- Potential for duplicate/conflicting results during transition
- Additional API endpoints to maintain

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Load all names**: Simple but doesn't scale, poor mobile experience
2. **Pure server-side search**: Responsive but requires network for every keystroke
3. **Fixed pagination**: Traditional but less smooth UX
